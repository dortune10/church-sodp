# Website Health Check Results

I have performed a health check on `www.rccgsodp.org` and found no issues. The site is responsive, pages load correctly, and key functional forms are visible.

## 1. Homepage & General Navigation
The homepage loads quickly. The hero section is fully visible, and navigation links work as expected.

## 2. Ministries
The ministries page displays correctly with aligned cards for different groups.
